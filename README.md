A new Flutter project demonstrating Firebase Authentication and Firestore integration with a simple user interface.

## Project Overview

This application allows users to sign up and log in using email and password authentication powered by Firebase Auth. Once authenticated, users can add their name and city to a Firestore database and view a list of all users. Users can also delete entries from the list. The UI uses pastel color themes and includes custom images for a more engaging experience.

## Features

- **User Signup & Login:** Secure authentication using Firebase Auth.
- **Firestore Integration:** Add, view, and delete user data (name and city) in real-time.
- **Logout:** Users can securely sign out from the app.
